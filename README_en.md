## What is Gameminer.net?

[GameMiner.net](http://gameminer.net/) is a unique and cool place where you can win Steam games absolutely for free.

## How to win? And what affects the chances of winning?

Enter the give aways! The winner is defined randomly. The less people, the better chance of winning. As a consequence in coal give aways chance to win lesser than in golden. 

## How do you get so much games to give away?

Common people like you and me give some cool stuff away here. Yea, that's right, sharing is cool.

## What is gold, coal where to get them and what are they for?

These are resources that you can use to join giveaways. Coal is free and replenishes hourly. Gold is way cooler, but you have to buy it or earn by creating gold giveaways. Minimum purchase amount - 20 gold

## If i created give away and earned 100 coal, but in profile i see: «Maximum coal: 50» where will the other 50 coal?

You will earn 100 coal. «Maximum coal: %Value%» means maximum value of coal that you will earn without creating give aways. (Your Coal per hour). if you had 50 coal when give away ended and you erned 300 coal your quantity of coal will be 350, but now you will not get coal per hour, as long as the amount of coal will fall below the maximum.

## What's the difference between private, golden and regular giveaways? And what is sandbox?

Common giveaways are cornerstone of GameMiner.net. Most games are being given away through common giveaways. But all the expensive or very neat games are usually given away in gold giveaways. Also, there are much less participants, so your chances to win are way higher.  
We use profits that come from gold giveaways towards site upkeep. Zag-zag.  
In Private giveaway you can play out everything you want (even your stinky socks), but for private give away you won't get experience or any resource.  
Sandbox is a place added where the questionable distribution of keys. To get out of the sandbox necessary to distribute minimum 3 working key.

## Is it mandatory to create giveaways? Can I just join all the giveaways instead of creating them?

You can join all you want, and sharing is always voluntary. But remember: girls like generous dudes.

## What's the deal with levels?

Level is what distinguishes boy from man. The higher your level is, the more coal you get per hour, invites per day, girls per lifetime. Also you can bump your trade topic more often.
The only way to increase your level is to create giveaways. That is our way in saying "thank you" to contributors.
All info about levels you can find [here](http://gameminer.net/forum/1/2069).

## How to create Giveaways?

Go here: http://gameminer.net/giveaway/create Choose the game. If there is no game in list, don’t try to choose similar - you will be banned. After selecting the game you can change the distribution of additional parameters, such as price and expiration date. There is no time limit for Gifts, but it is not recommended to put giveaway more than couple of months. The maximum time to hand out the key - 1 week.
